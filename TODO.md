<h1>To do:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Change the way that it repeats so the script is not always running</li>
<dl><dd> - probably by taking out all the loops and making a cronjob?</dd></dl>
<li>Change so it only runs once a mounth</li>
<li>Make yearly archiving feature</li>
<dl><dd> - so you have 1yr of mounthly backups, 1 mounths worth of daily and a yearly backup for every year run</dd></dl>
<li>Add disk verifcation after the cleaning with notifcations</li>
<dl><dd> - Will probably use <a href="https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier">terminal-notifier by julienXX </a> if I can find a way to intergrate  python with the shell script</dd>
<dd>This might be easier than I think it is but I have no time at the moment</dd></dl>
</ul>
